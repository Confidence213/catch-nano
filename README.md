A simple android game that I made for an introduction to android coding.

* Runnable
* Handler
* Vector drawable
* CountDownTimer
* Alert Dialog
* Layouts:
  - Constraint Layout
  - Linear Layout
  - Grid Layout


## About the game:

The users try to earn the highest score they can by clicking on the nano icons that appear on the screen as many times as possible until the time expires.
