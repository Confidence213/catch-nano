# Catch The Nano

A simple android game that I made for an introduction to android coding.

Learned and used:
* Custom Actionbar (Actionbars are outdated though)
* View Binding
* Runnable
* Handler
* Keeping images as xml file
* CountDownTimer
* Alert Dialog
* Layouts:
  - Constraint Layout
  - Linear Layout
  - Grid Layout


## About the game:

The users try to earn the highest score they can by clicking on the nano icons that appear on the screen as many times as possible until the time expires.

(TODO) â€¢> Add Screenshots and Gameplay video here...
